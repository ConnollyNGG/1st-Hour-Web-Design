				Forms of Communication
			</h2>

				<p>
					Today when you have a message to communicate, you have a decision to make. Do you stop by the person's office, call a staff meeting, call a staff meeting, use the telephone, write a letter or memo, send an email, or choose some other means of communication.
				</p>

					<h3>
						Oral Communication
					</h3>

						<p>
							Oral Communication is face to face and provides immediate feedback. The two-way flow of ideas permits an immediate response, lessening the chance for misunderstanding. Your voice, facial expressions, and gestures are additional aids in communicating a clear message.
						</p>

					<h3>
						Written Communication
					</h3>

						<p>
							Even though written messages are considered less personal than oral communication, they may be more efficient and appropriate because they provide a dated record that something has been communicated, and a visible reminder to follow up. Because complex messages may require a great deal of though by both the sender and receiver, putting a message in writing gives the sender and receiver more control over their messages. The sender can revise the message until it conveys the exact meaning intended. The receiver has the opportunity to re-read the message and plan the response.
						</p>

					<h3>
						Non-Verbal Communication
					</h3>

						<p>
							Everything you do or don't do in a sense communicates a message. Non-Verbal communication accompanies every oral and written message and either reinforces or contradicts it. Research indicates that the non-verbal message is more influential than the verbal.
