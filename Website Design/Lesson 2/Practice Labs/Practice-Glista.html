			<h1>Team Building Ten Commandments</h1>
		</header>

		<article>
			<ol>
				<li>Thou shalt consider the type of groups best suited to tackle thy task (advisory group, expert group, large group for brainstorming).
				<li>Thou shalt know thy communication style.
				<li>Thou shalt choose thy members wisely.
				<li>Thou shalt be the champion for their group's task.
				<li>Thou shalt get a few things straight among participants before proceeding (when will they meet, authority level of members).
				<li>Thou art empowered to demand things of thy participants.
				<li>Thou shalt have thy logistical house in order before any meeting (know why the meeting is taking place).
				<li>Thou shalt keep thy members and interested parties thoroughly apprised of the progress of thy group toward completion of its tasks.
				<li>Thou shalt act as consensus-builder, not Lord High Executioner.
				<li>Thou shalt promote mutual respect and discourage personal attacks among thy members.
